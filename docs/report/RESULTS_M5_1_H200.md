# M5.1-prod-a4 — Production training on Spheron H200 with persistent volume

> **Status**: smoke launched 2026-05-15 ~11:18 UTC after host migration to H200 + virtiofs persistent volume. Follows 4 prior M5.1 losses (a1/a1b/a2/a3) — see [`RESULTS_M5_1_B200.md` §10](RESULTS_M5_1_B200.md) for the a3 incident report. This run uses the new bulletproof uploader + external monitor + dual-repo backup + persistent volume to make host-loss recovery structurally possible.
>
> **Key changes vs a3**:
> - Hardware: 1× H200 SXM 141GB (vs B200 192GB) on Spheron with **persistent volume** (`miletone5`, 600 GB, virtiofs)
> - All artifacts (model, corpus, indexes, venv, ckpts, rollouts) live on `/mnt/miletone5/workspace/` — survives host preemption
> - Uploader rewritten in Python ([`upload_a4_to_hf.py`](../../training_m5_1/scripts/upload_a4_to_hf.py)) with heartbeat, dual-repo, ckpt priority, pre-flight
> - External monitor running on user's local Mac, polls HF every 5 min
> - Pre-launch checklist enforced ([`LAUNCH_CHECKLIST_A4.md`](../../training_m5_1/scripts/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST_A4.md))
>
> **Live trajectory**: this doc is the canonical narrative. Cadence checkpoints every 10 steps. Auto-committed to `experiment_1_h200` + pushed to GitHub + HF Hub. Pulled from a3's documented mistakes — no "uploader ✓" claims without verification, cadence triggers fire on step-file landing not on user prompt.

## 2. Config — diff vs a3

Branch `experiment_1_h200` diverges from `experiment_1_b200` only in the W&B/swanlab/mlflow project + run names (B200 → H200 a4). The training hyperparameters (config knobs) are unchanged from a3 (which was producing higher reward than A100 reference).

| # | Knob | a3 (B200) | a4 (H200) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `logger.wandb.project` | `reason_over_search_b200` | `reason_over_search_h200` | New W&B project |
| 2 | `logger.wandb.name` | `qwen3.5-0.8b-musique-b200-a3-seed42` | `qwen3.5-0.8b-musique-h200-a4-seed42` | New run name |
| 3 | `policy.train_micro_batch_size` | 2 | **2** (unchanged) | a3 producing higher reward than A100 ref — keep it |
| 4 | `policy.generation.vllm_cfg.gpu_memory_utilization` | 0.8 | **0.8** (unchanged) | 0.8 × 141 GB = 113 GB vLLM cache — plenty for 0.8B model |
| 5 | `grpo.max_num_steps` | 622 | 622 | 2 epochs of MuSiQue at 64 prompts/step |
| 6 | `checkpointing.save_period` | 50 | 50 | 12 ckpts at steps 50/100/.../600 |

All other paper-faithful hyperparameters (lr=1e-6, kl_penalty=0.001, ratio_clip=0.2, temperature=1.0, max_total_sequence_length=8192) are unchanged.

## 3. Persistent volume layout (`/mnt/miletone5/workspace/` on host = `/workspace/` in container)

```

**Persistence test passed**: a test file written on the previous H200 instance (`computeinstance-u00pxp20247myv137q`) is visible on this instance (`computeinstance-u00v4wrfbry6nx616p`) → **the volume survives host swaps**.

## 4. Pre-launch safety nets (the new infrastructure)

### 4.1 Bulletproof uploader (`upload_a4_to_hf.py`)
- Python (not bash) — proper exception handling, no silent-failure paths
- **Heartbeat every cycle** in `uploader.log` (proves the loop is iterating)
- **Checkpoint folder priority** — `step_N/` pushes before logs/rollouts
- **Aggressive retry** with exponential backoff (5/15/45/90/180 s on transient errors)
- **Pre-flight canary** — uploads a tiny test file at startup, exits 2 if HF unreachable
- **Dual-repo** — uploads to both primary and backup namespaces simultaneously
- **5-second filesystem scan** for new `step_N/` folders (vs 60s in a3's bash uploader)
- **JSON state file** with atomic writes (vs plain-text append in a3)

### 4.2 External monitor (`external_monitor.py`)
- Runs on user's **local Mac**, not the training instance
- Polls HF every 5 min, cross-references with W&B step count
- Reports STALE if no commit in 10 min
- Reports LAG if W&B step is >10 steps ahead of HF rollouts
- Tested against the dead a3 run: would have caught the failure at minute 11, not 11 hours

### 4.3 Launch checklist (`LAUNCH_CHECKLIST_A4.md`)
Explicit gate-by-gate verification. Every box must be checked before training:
- HF_TOKEN + HF_REPO_ID + HF_BACKUP_REPO_ID set
- Both repos created on HF
- Uploader pre-flight passes on both repos
- External monitor running on user's local Mac
- Volume mount verified persistent (destroy + recreate test)

### 4.4 Pre-launch gates passed (for this run)
| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| HF token set | ✓ in `.env` |
| Both repos created | ✓ (h200-a4-seed42 + h200-a4-backup) |
| Pre-flight uploads canary to both | ✓ both repos have `.preflight_canary.txt` |
| External monitor reports HEALTHY | ✓ verified at 11:15 UTC |
| Persistent volume mount tested | ✓ (file from previous host visible here) |
| NeMo-RL venv functional | ✓ torch 2.10 + cuda True + H200 visible |
| Retriever healthy | ✓ port 3005, 8/8 workers available |
| `.env` populated (WANDB_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN) | ✓ |
| Data: `train.parquet` is valid LFS-pulled parquet | ✓ (caught corrupt LFS pointer on first smoke attempt; fixed) |

## 5. Checkpoint plan

Saves every 50 steps. With `max_num_steps=622`, the canonical "final" checkpoint is **step_600** (the last save before max).

| Step | Save lands at (ETA from prod launch) | Cumulative spend (H200 @ $15.15/h) |
|---|---|---:|
| 50 | first ckpt, ~5 h from prod start | ~$76 |
| 100 | ~10 h | ~$152 |
| 200 | ~20 h | ~$303 |
| 311 (1 epoch) | ~30 h | ~$455 |
| 400 | ~40 h | ~$606 |
| 600 (last save) | ~60 h = 2.5 d | ~$909 |
| 622 (run end) | ~62 h = 2.6 d | ~$939 |

These are estimates based on smoke timing — will be revised after step 1 lands.

## 6. Cadence checkpoints

Every 10 steps. Each cadence:
1. Pull rollouts from W&B + HF
2. Run `analyze_rollouts.py` for window
3. Pick BEST / WORST / MEAN trajectories from the cadence-end step
4. Hand-analyze each (2-3 sentence commentary)
5. Append to this doc; commit to `experiment_1_h200`; push to GitHub
6. README on both HF repos updated
7. **Before ANY of the above**: verify uploader is healthy by checking heartbeat in `uploader.log` AND running external_monitor.py

## 7. Smoke verification status (in progress)

Smoke run `qwen3.5-0.8b-musique-h200-a4-smoke-seed42` running with 4 steps, save_period=2 → ckpts at steps 2, 4.

Will verify before prod:
- [ ] Smoke completes 4 steps
- [ ] step_2/ ckpt lands on disk
- [ ] step_2/ ckpt uploads to BOTH HF repos (primary + backup)
- [ ] step_4/ ckpt lands + uploads
- [ ] Rollout JSONLs (step1-4) all upload
- [ ] Uploader heartbeat log shows ≥4 cycles
- [ ] External monitor reports HEALTHY throughout

## 8. Live trajectory (TBD)

Per-step times + rewards will be filled in here as prod steps land. First step expected ~12-15 min after prod launch (vLLM init + first generation phase).

| Step | Wall (s) | Reward | Gen len | Tool calls | Trunc % | Notes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| TBD | | | | | | (filled at prod step 1) |

## 9. Cost / wall-clock estimate

H200 SXM 141GB at Spheron at $15.15/h. H200 is roughly:
- 0.6× B200's memory bandwidth (4.8 vs 8 TB/s)
- 0.44× B200's BF16 dense compute (989 vs 2250 TFLOPS)
- 1.76× A100's memory bandwidth (4.8 vs 2 TB/s)

Expected per-step wall vs measured anchors:
- A100 mean (a3 reference): ~24 min/step → ~250 h total
- B200 mean (a3 measured, 56 steps): ~9 min/step → projected ~95 h total
- H200 projected (BW-scaled from B200): ~14-16 min/step → ~150-165 h total ≈ 6-7 days

But: H200's 141 GB VRAM may allow `gpu_memory_utilization` headroom that helps, and our actual workload is bandwidth-bound not compute-bound — so H200 may perform closer to B200 than the compute ratio suggests.

**Estimate range for full run (622 steps)**: **2.5-7 days, $900-2500**. Revised after step 1.

## 10. The four prior losses (recap)

| # | When | Cost | Cause | Mitigation in a4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a1 step-50 ckpt crash | 2026-05-11 | ~$30 | `metric_name: "train/loss/mean"` violated NeMo-RL assertion | `metric_name: null` + smoke-verified |
| a1 rollout-corpus deletion | 2026-05-11 | 196 MB data loss | `rm -rf logs/exp_010` (prod) bundled with cleanup | Rollouts uploaded to HF (now to TWO repos) so single-machine deletion can't kill them |
| a2 zombie GPU misdiagnosis kill | 2026-05-12 | ~$21 | Misread `[Not Found]` in nvidia-smi | Kill-on-evidence rule |
| **a3 Spheron T3 spot preemption** | **2026-05-15** | **~$36 + step_50 ckpt** | **Spot host preempted ~step 56 + uploader silently dropped rollouts past step 18** | **Persistent volume + bulletproof uploader + external monitor + dual-repo backup** |

**Cumulative loss across M5.1**: ~$108 + 196 MB + 1 trained checkpoint.
